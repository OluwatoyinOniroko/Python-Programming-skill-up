Python Programming and Applied Projects
📌 Overview

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and mini-projects developed as part of my journey in mastering programming, data handling, and applied analytics. The projects demonstrate practical skills in data wrangling, APIs, NLP, file handling, web scraping, and visualization.

Each script focuses on a specific Python concept or applied task, moving from beginner-friendly exercises to real-world use cases.
